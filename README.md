# Variations on Alex Edwards's Snippetbox web-app

# Focus on these learning / practice styles:

1. Very explicit at first
2. Very streamlined, implicit later
   Go back and forth between the explicit and implicit,
   making things clear, then implying them

# Focus on these 4 themes:

1. Create meaningful constraints (types, scope (application-level vs request-level), etc)
2. Enable meaningful access (global variables, dependency injection, closures, interfaces, request-scoped context)
3. Idiomatic patterns (Router, Middleware Handler, Application Handler)
4. Major interfaces (http.Handler, io, fmt)
