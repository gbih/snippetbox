# Variations on Alex Edwards's Snippetbox web-app

# Special areas of focus:

1. Create meaningful constraints (types, scope (application-level vs request-level), etc)
2. Enable meaningful access (global variables, dependency injection, closures, interfaces, request-scoped context)
3. Idiomatic patterns (Router, Middleware Handler, Application Handler)
4. Major interfaces (http.Handler, io, fmt)
